This is my repo for the Museum of Candy project from Colt Steele's Web 
Development course. Over the course of this project I aim to utilize what
I've learned so far about HTML and semantic markup and CSS properties 
including Flexbox and the Bootstrap framework. I also aim to utilize the
basic Git workflow and terminal, including using effective Git message and
pushes to GitHub.
